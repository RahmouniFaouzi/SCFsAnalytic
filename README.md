# SCFsAnalytic
The purpose of this source code is to compute the stress concentration factors (SCFs) for predicting the first ply failure (FPF) of an orthotropic rectangular plate with single circular hole subjected to uniaxial load using Hencky-Von Mises distortion energy theory, Tsai-Hill failure theory and Hashin-Rotem failure theory.
